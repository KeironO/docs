Here you might (dependent on how well I do this) find a repository of resources that I have written from my experience home labbing.

## Who are you

My name is Keiron O'Shea, and I work at Cwm Taf University Health Board in Old South Wales.

Previously I spent too long at Aberystwyth University maxxing out my Education skill level, pretended to be a Biologist and worked on a project to exploit multi-omics datasets using the hip new Neural Network methods that were beginning to take hold in the mid 2010s.

I spend most, if not all of my time sat infront of a screen and quite enjoy doing it.
