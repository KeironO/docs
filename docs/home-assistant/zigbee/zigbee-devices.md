# Zigbee Devices List

Here's some stuff I've tried with ZHA.

## Zigbee Co-ordinators

| Sonoff CC2531 | £7.99 | https://www.mylocalbytes.com/products/sonoff-zigbee-cc2531-usb-dongle | Y    | Seems to work fine in current house. Picks up devices in the Office without issue. |
|               |       |                                                                       |      |                                                                                    |

## Sensors

| Sonoff SNZB-02 | £8.75 | https://www.mylocalbytes.com/products/snzb-02-zigbee-temperature-humidity-sensor | Y    | Works brilliantly. People complained that it only gave readings every 5 minutes, but that seems more than fine? |
| Aqara Indoor Air Quality Monitor|£33.99|Jeff Bezos|Y|Works absolutely fine |

|               |       |                                                                       |      |                                                                                    |
|               |       |                                                                       |      |                                                                                    |
